# Changelog

All notable changes to MediaTree are documented here.

---

## 0.1.04 (2026-06-07) — Home Library Sorting and Grid Fixes

### Android App

- Updated Android `versionCode` to `5` and `versionName` to `0.1.04`
- Fixed the home library grid so all media-library posters render without app-side truncation
- Persisted the home sort selection and prevented the default sort from racing against the saved user preference after app restart

---

## 0.1.03 (2026-06-07) — Update Experience and Player Gesture Polish

### Android App

- Updated Android `versionCode` to `4` and `versionName` to `0.1.03`
- Added update badges on the Settings tab and version row when a newer APK is available
- Made the version row open a fixed-height release-notes dialog with cancel and download actions, showing the latest release notes before leaving the app
- Improved the player temporary fast-forward gesture so long-press dragging keeps fast-forward active until release

---

## 0.1.02 (2026-06-06) — Multi-Backend and Build Reliability

### Android App

- Updated Android `versionCode` to `3` and `versionName` to `0.1.02`
- Added support for multiple Jellyfin/Emby backend profiles from Settings; adding a new backend no longer overwrites the active Jellyfin/Emby profile
- Android build entrypoints now prefer Android Studio's bundled JBR 21 and avoid the Homebrew OpenJDK 26 `jlink`/JAR transform failure path

---

## 0.1.01 (2026-06-05) — Settings and Login Polish

### Android UI

- Updated Android `versionCode` to `2` and `versionName` to `0.1.01`
- Set the default theme mode to follow the Android system setting and refreshed the default green theme palette
- Centered the shared backend setup empty state across home, browse, and favorites when no usable backend is configured
- Kept snackbar messages above the overlay bottom navigation so transient prompts remain visible
- Refined the home top bar chrome and sort action icon for a cleaner overlay layout

### Connections

- Backend profiles are now saved only after login succeeds; saved-but-unauthenticated server URLs no longer load remote content
- Added per-profile backend logout in the server connection editor instead of a global "logout all" action
- Removed the manual backend scan button from Settings; MediaTree scans are triggered from home refresh or backend library selection
- Routed Settings success messages through the shared snackbar channel instead of inline status rows
- Reused `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` for MediaBrowser authorization headers so Jellyfin/Emby requests report the built app version

---

## 0.1.00 (2026-06-04) — First Android App Release

### Android UI

- Added a Material 3 native Android UI refresh for home, browse, favorites, settings, and detail screens
- Added mixed favorite grids, poster/episode media cards, folder browsing cards, and updated detail sections for cast, episodes, stills, and staff
- Reworked the bottom navigation and primary top bars as translucent overlays that fade and slide away while scrolling media lists
- Added settings sections for backend connection, library display, scan trigger, and local SMB server draft input
- Normalized Android `versionName` to `0.1.00`
- Prepared release APK builds with R8 code shrinking, resource shrinking, `arm64-v8a` ABI filtering, signed release configuration, SHA-256 checksums, and `MediaTree-App-0.1.00.apk` artifact naming
- Added Telegram release notifications for published APKs: files under the Bot API cloud upload limit are sent directly, while larger APKs fall back to GitHub Release links
- Disabled Android user-data backup for stored server tokens and SMB/WebDAV secrets
- Removed leftover Capacitor template tests from the native Android project

### Android App

- Added the native Android project under `frontend/android/`, including Compose navigation, mpv playback, API client models, session storage, native playback libraries, and Gradle wrapper

### App Scope

- Replaced the README branding with a rounded MediaTree logo asset and rewrote the README as a concise user-facing app page with APK download links, source compatibility, and screenshot placeholders
- Added README links for the recommended `ZASENJC/mediatree` backend pairing, Telegram discussion group, and Telegram update channel
- Strengthened the pre-push rule to keep `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CHANGELOG_zh-CN.md`, `README.md`, and `README_zh-CN.md` synced with the current app state
- Removed backend, Docker/deployment, legacy React/Vite frontend, and server wiki files from Git tracking so the repository now tracks app code only
- Moved local backend/reference, generated data, old web frontend, and local agent/config files under ignored `_reference/` directories
- Added ignore rules that keep local backend/reference files available without reintroducing them to the app Git tree
- Updated the release workflow to build and publish the Android APK instead of packaging backend and web frontend update archives
- Clarified that `mediatree-app` is an Android client repository and connects to an existing MediaTree backend instead of bundling backend services into the APK
- Changed `npm run android:build` to run the native Gradle app build directly without `cap sync android`
- Clarified that native Android builds do not require `npm install` or `node_modules`
- Added Android build-output ignore rules for Gradle artifacts, `local.properties`, and copied web assets
- Reworked README and Android documentation around app-only builds, backend API compatibility, and APK output

## v1.0.03 (2026-05-25)

### App-Package Updates

- **Lightweight app-package updates**: Settings now downloads `mediatree-app-<version>.tar.gz` into `/app/data/releases`, so routine releases no longer need a full Docker image pull
- **Docker socket is advanced-only**: the default compose example no longer mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`; full image replacement remains available for base-image changes
- **Rollback and status tracking**: added `/api/update/status` and `/api/update/rollback`; failed app-package updates can roll back to the previous app package or the built-in image version
- **Release artifacts**: GitHub Releases now include the app archive, manifest, and sha256 checksum for update type, size, and integrity checks

### Settings Update UX

- The update panel always shows only the latest 3 versions
- App-package progress now appears inside the matching version card, and completed status no longer appears as a separate bar
- Rollback moved into the matching version row beside the changelog action
- Full image updates show Docker pull/helper logs directly inside the version card

### Player

- Added immersive Theater Mode with a dedicated viewing route, ambient backdrop, and focused playback layout
- Improved Theater Mode routing, controls, and exit behavior

### Deployment & Mobile

- Docker image layout now separates `/opt/mediatree/base` from updateable app packages under `/app/data/releases`
- Added an entrypoint launcher that prefers the current data-volume app package and falls back to the previous package or built-in base app
- Added Capacitor/Android build configuration and native app server URL support

---

## v1.0.02 (2026-05-25)

### UI Improvements

- **Toast z-index fix**: toast notifications and scan progress now render via `createPortal` to `document.body`, fixing an issue where they were hidden behind modal backdrops due to `#root` stacking context
- **Manual scrape progress toast**: after applying a manual scrape result, a progress indicator appears in the bottom-right with indeterminate animation, then auto-dismisses on completion
- **TMDB config warning**: toast reminder to configure TMDB API Key in Settings when performing scrape operations without TMDB credentials

### Backend

- `/api/config` now returns `tmdb_configured` field for frontend TMDB config detection

---

## v1.0.01 (2026-05-24)

### Performance

- **Scroll optimization**: `content-visibility: auto` on all media grid cards — browser skips rendering off-screen cards entirely
- **CSS containment**: `contain: layout style` on grid containers prevents layout thrashing during scroll
- Reduced `glass-card` backdrop-blur from 12px to 6px — negligible visual difference, 50% less GPU blur computation
- Narrowed `apple-focus` transition from `transition-all` to only `transform`, `box-shadow`, `border-color`
- Body noise texture (`feTurbulence` SVG) promoted to GPU compositing layer with `translateZ(0)`
- All 5 grid pages (Home, Folder, Browse, Favorites, MovieCard) now use `media-grid` and `media-grid-card` classes

### Self-Update Rewrite

- **docker inspect driven**: no longer depends on compose file mounts or `COMPOSE_FILE` env var — extracts container runtime configuration via `docker inspect`
- **Dual-path support**: compose-managed containers auto-reconstruct compose YAML + `compose up -d`, bare `docker run` containers auto-replay run commands
- **Version detection**: `get_current_version()` prefers Docker image tag via inspect, VERSION file as fallback; normalization supports `-test` suffix
- **Removed dependency**: no longer needs `docker-compose-plugin`; Dockerfile and compose template cleaned up
- **Version format**: `v` prefix removed, unified `1.0.01` format

### Fixes

- Scraper: switching to "none" immediately stops scraping and clears previously scraped content
- Browse page: removed JavDB score/likes badges, display filename as title, folder tree now follows sort order
- Fixed 10 CodeQL security alerts + subtitle test assertions
- CHANGELOG modal now renders via `createPortal` with proper Markdown rendering
- Removed `docker-compose.yml` from git tracking, replaced with `.example` template
- Logout fix: no longer clears active library on logout; `?logout=1` query param distinguishes explicit logout from fresh visit
- Settings page auto-polls version after update; button renamed to "切换到此版本"
